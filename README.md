# Module 6: Tidying and Organizing Data in R

**Part 1: Read "Data Organization in Spreadsheets"**

Karl W. Broman & Kara H. Woo (2018), [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989), The American Statistician, 72(1): 2-10 

**Part 2: Work through R4DS Chapter 12: Tidy data** 
- Required: [R4DS Chapter 12, Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)

**Part 3: Watch and work alongside the video lectures**
- [Why do we care about tidying data?](https://youtu.be/9dIKnQHrawk)
- [Identifying messy elements of a dataset](https://youtu.be/9mz0BR1zqsY)
  - The dataset discussed in this video is from: Ernest, Morgan; Brown, James; Valone, Thomas; White, Ethan P. (2017): Portal Project Teaching Database. figshare. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1. Discussion points were derived from: Peter R. Hoyt, Christie Bahlai, Tracy K. Teal (Eds.), Erin Alison Becker, Aleksandra Pawlik, Peter Hoyt, Francois Michonneau, Christie Bahlai, Toby Reiter, et al.

**Part 4: Complete the homework**

The homework is described in the `HW-tidying-cotton-data.html` file (also available as a PDF) in this repository. I recommend working from the html file as opposed to the PDF as the formatting is a bit nicer. You will need to push your code to your GitHub repository, and submit a link to your GitHub repository through the Moodle assignment.
